# Learn OpenGL
This is a public repository of me learning OpenGL together with CMake.  
This code might not be the most optimal 99% of the time, but that's the neat part about learning stuff!

## Build
If you have CMake, make sure to build it directly after cloning this repo. If right it should retrieve every needed library.
